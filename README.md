# p2-bezier-curves

Using the last deriviation of the quadradic bezer curves from wikipedia. Create a Go module that generates Bezier curves. Although the initial work is graphical. I want to be able to use the library to generate function that gives y for x, where x is time. The eventual idea is to use this as the basis for an animation system.
